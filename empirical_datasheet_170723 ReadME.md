## Variables 
Date: Date of Measurement. In dd/mm/yy format.

Site: Site that the sample point is present in. Either Silwood or Barnes.

Surveyor  = Name of the person surveying the sample point. Either Poorvi Ashok or Emma Little.

Sample Point = Unique ID allocated for each sample point.

Tree_ID: ID of the tree with the Audiomoth.

Long: Longitudinal data for sample point in DD format for N. Measured using a GPS at the sample point.

Lat: Latitudinal data for sample point in DD format for W. Measured using a GPS at the sample point.

Accuracy: Accuracy of GPS reading (in m). Measured from the GPS.

Distance_from_water_body: Distance to nearest water body that is not ephemeral, and larger than 20 square meters (in m)

Distance_from_building: Distance to nearest in-use building (in m)

Distance_from_woodland: Distance to nearest woodland, defined as area of unbroken canopy cover > 0.5 hectares in size and wider at all times than one tree (zero if within woodland) (in m)

Distance_from_woodland_edge: Distance to nearest edge, defined as clear boundary between woodland and other habitat or land use eg wide road parting the canopy (in m)

Distance_from_road: Distance to nearest two-way, non-dead-end road (in m)

Distance_from_rail: Distance to nearest railway line (in m)

Distance_from_any_artificial_light: Distance to nearets artificial light on consistently at night - including streetlamps (in m)

Distance_from_streetlamp: Distance to nearest streetlamps (in m)

Distance_from_nearest_light: Distance to the nearest light source either artificial light or streetlamp (in m)

Distance_from_nearest_noise: Distance to the nearest noise source either road or rail (in m)

Compass_direction_to_understorey_canopy_cover_measurement: Direction of the measurement, 5m in the direction specified. Either N, S, E, or W.

Para_0_value: Number of pixels that are white in threshold adjusted photo parallel to the compass direction. Measured using ImageJ.

Para_255_value: Number of pixels that are black in threshold adjusted photo parallel to the compass direction. Measured using ImageJ.

Perp_0_value: Number of pixels that are white in threshold adjusted photo perpendicular to the compass direction, Measured using ImageJ.

Perp_255_value: Number of pixels that are black in threshold adjusted photo perpendicular to the compass direction. Measured using ImageJ.

Gap val 1: Ratio of black pixels to total number of pixels present in the parallel direction.

Gap val 2: Ratio of black pixels to total number of pixels present in the perpendicular direction.

Av gap val: Average of Gap val 1 and Gap val 2.

Quarter point: The quarter for the measurement of the nearest tree. Either 1 - NE, 2 - SE, 3 - SW, 4 - NW.

Distance_nearest_tree: Using point-centred quarter method, distance to the nearest live, standing tree of >=30cm circumference at 130cm height (in cm)

Lux_positioning: The positioning of the Lux meter (Minolta Illuminance Meter T-1) for the measurement. Either vertical or horizontal. 

Lux_Night_1: Illuminance measurement 1 in the night using Minolta Illuminance Meter T-1 (in lux).

Lux_Night_2: Illuminance measurement 2 in the night using Minolta Illuminance Meter T-1 (in lux).

Light_Average: Average of Lux_Night_1 and Lux_Night_2 (in lux). 

UV_Night_1: UV measurement 1 in the night using RS PRO mini pocket UV AB meter IM-213 (in milliwatts per square centimetre (mW/cm2)).

UV_Night_2: UV measurement 2 in the night using RS PRO mini pocket UV AB meter IM-213 (in milliwatts per square centimetre (mW/cm2)).
