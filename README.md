# Light and Noise have Interacting Effects on Bird Activity at both Short-term and Long-term Scales 

This project was done in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at Imperial College London.
Submitted for MSc Ecology, Evolution and Conservation. 

This project investigates the effects on anthropogenic pressures, in particular light and noise on bird activity at a landscape level. The code here cleans and wrangles the data obtained and thereafter performs statistical analysis testing the effects of light and noise on bird activity. 

This project is currently a work in progress.


## Requirements 

* [R] (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/): Version 4.3.2
